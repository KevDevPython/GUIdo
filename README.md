# GUIdo

## Overview

Pygame GUI library, named after the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, believing that this library will be the first to implement a GUI completely compatible with pygame. Included is a "mini-OS" to show off all the elements. That "mini-OS" is called *Winnux 58* (**Win**dows 9**5** + **Win**dows 9**8** + Li**nux**).

~~i kinda hate this name now~~

## Features

-   A working command line, with these *nix-style commands*:
    -   `pwd`: print working directory
    -   `ls`: list file and directories
    -   `rm`: remove file(s)
    -   `cd`: change directory
-   A command-line text editor, `vis`
-   SNAKE! (with an incredibly high framerate soo good luck with that)
-   A virtual disk to put programs in

Please check our [wiki](https://github.com/The-UltimateGamer/GUIdo/wiki) for more details.

## NEVER TRY TO MOUNT `files.img`

## Directory structure:
- `/home/`

    - test.txt
    (Note: this is created for the testing of the `cat` command.)

- `/sys/`

    - kernel.py
    (This is where our OS boots. **DO NOT TRY TO DELETE IT.**)
