# GUIdo

## Overview

Pygame GUI library, named after the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, believing that this library will be the first to implement a GUI completely compatible with pygame. Included is a "mini-OS" to show off all the elements.

## Features

-   A working command line, with these *nix-style commands*:
    -   `pwd`: print working directory
    -   `ls`: list file and directories
    -   `rm`: remove file(s)
    -   `cd`: change directory
-   A command-line text editor, `vis`
-   SNAKE! (with an incredibly high framerate soo good luck with that)
-   A virtual disk to put programs in

Please check our [wiki](https://github.com/The-UltimateGamer/GUIdo/wiki) for more details.

## NEVER TRY TO MOUNT `files.img`

## Directory structure:
/home/
- test.txt
(Note: this is created for the testing of the `cat` command.)
/sys/
- kernel.py
(This is where our OS boots.)
