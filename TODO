- Integrate TextDraw.py and the buffer provided into kernel.py
  Specifications:
  - Should contain a variable that controls the availability of the buffer
  - Because of this, apps will trigger the buffer by setting the value of that variable
  - Should have a button to go back (to the desktop), which means integrating a button too
  - Preferably make this into a class and make the buffer sizeable
